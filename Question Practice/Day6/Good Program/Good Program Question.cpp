Problem
In computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble.

Chef defines a program as:

Good, if it takes exactly 
 
X nibbles of memory, where 
 
X is a positive integer.
Not Good, otherwise.
Given a program which takes 
 
N bits of memory, determine whether it is Good or Not Good.

Input Format
First line will contain 
 
T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer 
 
N, the number of bits taken by the program.
Output Format
For each test case, output 
Good
Good or 
Not
 
Good
Not Good in a single line. You may print each character of 
Good
Good or 
Not
 
Good
Not Good in uppercase or lowercase (for example, 
GoOd
GoOd, 
GOOD
GOOD, 
good
good will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case 1: The program requires 
8
8 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 
8
4
=
2
4
8
​
 =2 nibbles. Since 
2
2 is an integer, this program is good.

Test case 2: The program requires 
17
17 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 
17
4
=
4.25
4
17
​
 =4.25 nibbles. Since 
4.25
4.25 is not an integer, this program is not good.

Test case 3: The program requires 
52
52 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 
52
4
=
13
4
52
​
 =13 nibbles. Since 
13
13 is an integer, this program is good.

Test case 4: The program requires 
3
3 bits of memory. This is equivalent to 
3
4
=
0.75
4
3
​
 =0.75 nibbles. Since 
0.75
0.75 is not an integer, this program is not good.
